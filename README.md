# Enzo_iso_cluster
This is the repo containing a version of Enzo for doing AGN feedback simulations in active particle framework in isolated galaxy, groups and clusters. 
Not to be merged with the main Enzo branch as it will create too many conflicts. 

This git version of Enzo contains galaxy group and cluster initialisation generated using the cluster gravitational and baryon entropy profile. 
It does AGN feedback using Active particle framework. 
This also contains Suderland-Dopita tabulated cooling function for 0.3 and 1 solar metallicity.

This repo has been created by Deovrat Prasad, June 2022.
